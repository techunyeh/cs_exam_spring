1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Samrtphine that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    int number;
    public class Smartphone{String name, int number){
    this.name=name;
    this.number=number;
    }
    


b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.

Polymorphism means once we got a child class, we are able to use objects of that child class
wherever we would use objects of the parent class. Java will automatically refer to the right methods.



c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
public void speak(){
System.out.println("I'm"+name+"Call me with"+number);
}

d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
Interface
